## 📋 Overview

Pipeline Guardian is an intelligent monitoring system that captures, analyzes, and optimizes GCP data pipeline performance in real-time. Built to demonstrate production-grade data engineering practices with AI integration.

### Current Status: Phase 1 ✅
- ✅ Real-time log aggregation pipeline
- ✅ BigQuery scheduled query monitoring
- ✅ Pub/Sub → BigQuery native integration
- ⏳ AI root cause analysis (Phase 2)
- ⏳ Predictive anomaly detection (Phase 3)
- ⏳ Cost optimization recommendations (Phase 4)
- ⏳ Real-time dashboard (Phase 5)

## 🏗️ Architecture (Phase 1)

![Architecture Diagram](docs/The-GCP-Pipeline-guardian-Phase1-Architecture.pdf)

### Data Flow
1. **BigQuery Scheduled Query** runs every 10 minutes (simulated pipeline)
2. **Cloud Logging** captures audit logs
3. **Log Router** filters for `bigquery_resource` events
4. **Pub/Sub Topic** streams filtered logs
5. **Pub/Sub Subscription** writes directly to BigQuery (native integration)
6. **BigQuery Table** stores logs as JSON for flexible querying

**Latency:** <1 second end-to-end

## 🎯 Key Features

### Phase 1 (Complete)
- **Real-time ingestion**: Sub-second latency from log generation to storage
- **Flexible schema**: JSON storage allows for schema evolution
- **Cost-optimized**: $0/month using GCP free tier
- **Production patterns**: Dead letter queues, retry logic, regional deployment

### Upcoming Phases
- **Phase 2**: Gemini AI integration for root cause analysis
- **Phase 3**: BigQuery ML anomaly detection
- **Phase 4**: AI-driven cost optimization
- **Phase 5**: Streamlit dashboard on Cloud Run
